1. Download Data as CSV.
2. Open as Excel and Copy the column names.
3. Open pgAdmin and create a new database.
Code:
-- SQL Retail Sales Analysis - P1
CREATE DATABASE sql_project_p1;

4. Open the database created and create tables in it. (format the dates in YYYY-MM-DD)
Code: 
-- Creating table
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS retail_sales;
CREATE TABLE retails_sales
	(
		transactions_id	INT PRIMARY KEY,
		sale_date DATE,
		sale_time TIME,
		customer_id	INT,
		gender VARCHAR(15),
		age	INT,
		category VARCHAR(15),	
		quantiy INT,
		price_per_unit FLOAT,	
		cogs FLOAT,
		total_sale FLOAT
	);

5. Now fill in the tables with data by Importing the data into your tables(turn off the Headers from options as we've already added the headers.
6. Check if all the data has been inserted properly and incase of errors check them and fix them from the "View Processes" option and match the number of rowns in the table(using Count function) with the CSV or Excel file.
7. Now we deal w the Null values that may be present in your dataset.
You can check the null values in each column using-
Code:
SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE transactions_id IS NULL;
you may do it for all the columns one by one(VERY methodic and boring btw)
or you may use-
Code: 

SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE
	transactions_id IS NULL
	OR
	sale_date IS NULL
	OR
	sale_time IS NULL
	OR
	customer_id IS NULL
	OR
	gender IS NULL
	OR
	age IS NULL
	OR
	category IS NULL
	OR
	quantity IS NULL
	OR
	cogs IS NULL
	OR
	total_sale IS NULL;

We can either delete it or enter values(if we've values)

8. Deleting data
Code:
DELETE FROM retail_sales
WHERE
	transactions_id IS NULL
	OR
	sale_date IS NULL
	OR
	sale_time IS NULL
	OR
	gender IS NULL
	OR
	category IS NULL
	OR
	quantity IS NULL
	OR
	cogs IS NULL
	OR
	total_sale IS NULL;

9. Now the data cleaning is done. We move to data exploration.

Q1. how many sales do we have?
Code: 
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_sale FROM retail_sales;

Q2. How many unique customers do we have?
Code:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) as total_sale FROM retail_sales;

Q3. How many unique categories do we have?
Code:
SELECT DISTINCT category FROM retail_sales;

10. Now lets move to data analysis and answering some key business questions.

Q.1 Write a SQL query to retrieve all columns for sales made on '2022-11-05
Code:
SELECT * 
FROM retail_sales
WHERE
	sale_date = '2022-11-05';

Q.2 Write a SQL query to retrieve all transactions where the category is 'Clothing' and the quantity sold is more than 10 in the month of Nov-2022
Code:
SELECT 
	category,
 	SUM(quantity)
FROM retail_sales
WHERE category='Clothing'
	AND
	TO_CHAR(sale_date,'YYYY-MM') = '2022-11'
GROUP BY 1
-- 1 signifies that we're using group by on 1st item from the Select list(you may also use GROUP BY category)
--TO_CHAR is used to convert date or time stamps n such data into strings and format is: TO_CHAR(value , format) and here value= sale_date and format is YYYY-MM bcz qn asks for November 2022

Q.3 Write a SQL query to calculate the total sales (total_sale) for each category.
Code:
SELECT 
	category,
	SUM(total_sale)	 as net_sale,
	COUNT(*) as total_orders
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY 1
;


Q.4 Write a SQL query to find the average age of customers who purchased items from the 'Beauty' category.
Code:
SELECT 
	ROUND(AVG(age),2) as Average_age
FROM retail_sales
WHERE category = 'Beauty';

Q.5 Write a SQL query to find all transactions where the total_sale is greater than 1000.
Code:
SELECT *
FROM retail_sales
WHERE
total_sale > 1000;


Q.6 Write a SQL query to find the total number of transactions (transaction_id) made by each gender in each category.
Code:
SELECT 
	category,
	gender,
	COUNT(*) as total_transactions
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category, gender
ORDER BY 1;


Q.7 Write a SQL query to calculate the average sale for each month. Find out best selling month in each year
Code:
SELECT 
		year,
		month,
		avg_sale
FROM
(
	SELECT 
		EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) as year,
		EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sale_date) as month,
		AVG(total_sale) as avg_sale,
		RANK() 
			OVER(
				PARTITION BY EXTRACT (YEAR FROM sale_date) 
				ORDER BY AVG(total_sale) DESC) 
			AS rank
	FROM retail_sales
	GROUP BY 1, 2
	) as t1
	WHERE rank = 1;


--Extract used to "extract" ;-; the year or date or wtv from the column name(MySQL has YEAR as a function)
--we descended 3 bcz we need HIGHEST figure and ordering by 2 i.e month will order it in ascending~
--Rank function used: RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY column_name
				ORDER BY column DESC)
#it basically ranks the shi w separations in form of years or classes and OVER helps it not collapse the columns
--subquery being used here (table inside table) so the inner query 

Q.8 Write a SQL query to find the top 5 customers based on the highest total sales 
Code:
SELECT 
	customer_id,
	SUM (total_sale) AS total_sales
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 5;

Q.9 Write a SQL query to find the number of unique customers who purchased items from each category.
Code:
SELECT
	category,
	COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) as Unique_cust
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY 1;

Q.10 Write a SQL query to create each shift and number of orders (Example Morning <=12, Afternoon Between 12 & 17, Evening >17)
Code:
WITH hourly_sale AS( 
SELECT *,
		CASE
			WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time)<12 THEN 'Morning'
			WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) BETWEEN 12 AND 17 THEN 'Afternoon'
			ELSE 'Evening'
		END as shift
FROM retail_sales)
SELECT 
	shift,
	COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM hourly_sale
GROUP BY shift;

--CTE being used w different cases and table in tabl

11. Tada we're done w the basic analysis!
